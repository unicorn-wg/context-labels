              Using Context Strings in Digital Signatures
                 draft-thomson-saag-sig-context-latest

Abstract

   A single digital signature key is often relied upon to produce
   signatures that have different semantics.  This produces a potential
   problem whereby signatures with different intended uses can be
   confused.  The addition of context strings in signatures removes this
   problem.

1.  Introduction

   There are a handful of cryptographic primitives that are used to
   build protocols that are used on the Internet: digital signatures,
   key derivation algorithms, message integrity codes, etc..  These
   protocols are generally developed in isolation from each other, with
   minimal effort to ensure that data structures used in one protocol do
   not have plausible interpretations in other protocols.  This gives an
   opportunity for cross-protocol attacks, wherein a well-behaved
   participant in one protocol can be abused by an attacker to create a
   cryptographic object that, when interpreted by a different protocol,
   introduces a vulnerability.  Including a unique protocol-specific
   context label as input to all cryptographic operations prevents a
   cryptographic object created in one protocol from being interpreted
   in the context of a different protocol.  To avoid breaking existing
   protcols, only new constructs can be given such context labels as
   they are added to protocols, but cross-protocol attacks will be
   avoided between primitives/protocols that do use context lables.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Signature Functions with Context

   The following signature schemes define an explicit context string
   argument:

   o  Ed448 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] defines a "context" argument.

Internet-Draft              Signature Context                 April 2016


   o  HKDF [RFC5869] specifies an "info" argument to the HKDF-Expand
      function.

3.  Generic Signature with Context

   Many pre-existing signature schemes do not define an explicit context
   string.  This document defines a method for using context strings in
   existing signature functions.

   Given a signature function S that takes a key K and message M as a
   sequence of octets, this section defines a signature with context
   function Sc.  The signature with context function takes three
   arguments, K, M, and a context string C as a sequence of octets and
   is defined as:

      Sc(K, M, C) = S(K, C || M)

   That is, the signature is changed to accept a message that is the
   concatenation of the context and the message.

   This scheme MUST be used with:

   o  RSA (both PKCS#1 and PSS) [RFC3447]

   o  ECDSA [X9.62]

   o  HMAC [RFC2104]  ???

   o  Ed25519 [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa]

4.  Recommendations for Signature Context Strings

   In order to avoid attacks that permit use of signatures for purposes
   other than intended, the context C MUST NOT be a prefix of any other
   signature context string.

   New specifications defining context strings for use in signing,
   SHOULD select context strings that end with a single zero-valued
   octet and do not contain any other zero-valued octets.  Context
   strings SHOULD be at least 12 octets in length.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes "Signature Context String" registry.

   Entries in this registry contain the following fields:

Internet-Draft              Signature Context                 April 2016


   Context string:  A sequence of octets between 1 and 255 octets in
      length

   Specification:  A reference to a specification describing the use of
      the context string.

   Context strings in this registry MUST NOT be a prefix of any other
   context string in the registry.  For example, if 0x0100 is
   registered, then a registration for 0x01 or 0x010000 MUST be
   rejected.

   A context string that is at least 12 octets in length and contains
   exactly one zero-valued octet at the end can be registered on a
   First-Come, First-Served basis [RFC5226].  Context strings that do
   not meet these requirements require Expert Review [RFC5226].
